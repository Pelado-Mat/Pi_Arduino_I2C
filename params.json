{"name":"How to connect Paspberry Pi to Arduino using I2C and SMBus","tagline":"Complete how-to for connecting and using I2C bus and SMBus between a Raspberry Pi and one or more Arduinos","body":"### Welcome!\r\nThe power of the Raspberry Pi and the versatility of the Arduino are just waiting to be unified. Both devices are I2C ready, and the connection does not require any of the USB or Serial ports needed to connect a PC or programmer to either device.\r\n\r\n### I2C is simple and versatile\r\nIt is quite easy to connect the two devices together over I2C, and getting the communication working is very easy, once you understand what both devices need to do. Up to now, it has been difficult to get all the required information together for the first-time novice. I hope this contribution will be of use to the novice and experienced user alike.\r\n\r\n### Contacting me\r\nLet me know whether this has helped you to make sense and success of your application of I2C between the Pi and the Arduino. I'd love to know what you are working on, and will always be happy to help out if you have questions. Find me @MikeOchtman or look for me on LinkedIn.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
