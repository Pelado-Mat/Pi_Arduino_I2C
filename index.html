<p>The power of the Raspberry Pi and the versatility of the Arduino are just waiting to be unified. Both devices are I2C ready, and the connection does not require any of the USB or Serial ports needed to connect a PC or programmer to either device.</p>

<p>It is quite easy to connect the two devices together over I2C, and getting the communication working is very easy, once you understand what both devices need to do. Up to now, it has been difficult to get all the required information together for the first-time novice. I hope this contribution will be of use to the novice and experienced user alike.</p>
